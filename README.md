Hydrangea Archives is a game project created by the people behind GPT-R Productions,
combining both trivia and combat mechanics into a fun singleplayer experience! 
Fight enemy squads, answer wacky questions, and learn more about the game's underlying lore!
And of course... create your own questionnaires and challenge the knowledge of your friends!

The files in this repository are Hydrangea Archives' guts, so please take care of them once
you're given the opportunity to change certain parts and game files. Thanks!
